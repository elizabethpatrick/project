Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it's technically not a programming language, but instead, a markup language. For now, we'll think of it as a glorified word document. In a word document, you can create text headers, add links, display images and well, HTML isn't that different.

1.1 Creating an HTML Document
To get started coding in HTML, we first need to create an HTML document. We can do that by initializing a new file, just as if we we're create a standard word document, giving it any name followed by the .html suffix. For example ->

index.html

This file should be located within a folder that is known as your project directory. We can have multiple HTML files within the project directory, where each file can be used as a subroute for our HTML webpage.

The default HTML page will always be the one named index.html. An example project directory is as follows:

project_directory
|- index.html
|- about.html
|- contact.html

1.2 Initializing an HTML Document
Now that we have our project created our document, we can go ahead and open it up. HTML documents always start off with a little bit of boilerplate code that looks as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        visible content goes here . . .
    </body>
</html>
If you're using VSCode as your editor, we can quickly generate this boilerplate code using the intellisense. If you type the ! key, it will prompt you to create the code.

1.2.1 Local Development
You could right click on index.html and then click open with live server to see how it would look as you code.
To get your code live in a local development environment & to see how it looks, simply drag and drop any html file (typically the index.html) onto your browser. Page refresh after saving changes to your HTML document to see the updated changes.

1.3 HTML Tags
If we take a look at the code displayed above, there's a few key observations worth taking note of.

HTML is created using tags. Tags (sometimes referred to as elements) are the keywords surrounded by the greater-than and lesser-than brackets, or the < & > keys.
Most tags have an opening and paired closing tag. Any contents contained within the associated opening and closing tags is known as the children contents. The opening tag always appears first, and the closing tag can be discerned from the opening tag via the use of the forwards slash /.
For example -> <div> child contents </div>
The left hand tag is the opening tag, and the right most tag is the closing tag as we see it has the forwards slash.
Some tags are self closing. This means that the opening tag has a forwards slash at the end of the tag as opposed to at the start of the closing tag.
<input />
HTML tags are either semantic or non-semantic. Semantic tags imply more meaning about the subcontents that non-semantic tags. Some examples of semantic tags are as follows:
Single use <head> · <body> · <header> · <nav> · <footer> · <main>
Multi use <section> · <details> · <summary> · <aside> · <time>
Tag pairs contained within other tag pairs are known as Nested tags.

1.4 HTML Tag Functionalities
HTML tags in general typically serve 1 of 3 general purposes -> container, typography, or miscellaneous.

-> Container Tags deal with the containerization or grouping of contents. This could be by arranging associated contents in a row, in a column, or even in a grid. We can think of it as if we we're organizing clothing within a set of drawers. We might have a drawer for all things lower body, and within the draw we might have individual subcontainers for shorts, socks and undergarmets, and perhaps socks are further segregated into grouping of long socks and short socks.

Typically the containerization of contents is determined by the relatability of the content. If some information pertains to some other, we'll likely contain them together. Equally the relation might be determined by styling requirements; i.e. this element is spaced or styled depending on another. The primary container tags are as follows:

Semantic Container Tags
<head></head>
contains meta information about the HTML web page; single-use
<body>all visable page contents</body>
contains all the visable page contents; single-use
<header></header
contains contents that creates the page header (logo, navigation links etc...); single-use
<nav></nav>
contains all the page navigation links; single-use
<main></main>
contains the main page content (everything not in header or footer); single-use
<footer></footer>
contains the footer info (contact details, privacy policy, terms of use etc...); single-use
<aside>highlighted text</aside>
contains information for side navigation bar
<form><input/></form>
contains form information/inputs/textareas for user interaction
<section>highlighted text</section>
contains large generally-related sections of contents
<ul><li>list item within an unordered list</li></ul>
unordered list (ul) contains 1 or more list items
Non-semantic Container Tags
<div></div>
the most commonly used container tag
<span>Click me</span>
used for special inline styling of certain contents
-> Typography Tags are for all things text related. Most of us are familiar with the typography options in a word document and HTML isn't so different. We have 6 tiers of heading typography tags:

<h1>Heading 1 - the biggest font & size (only for titles and main headings)</h1> 
<h2>Heading 2 - 2nd biggest</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6 - the smallest heading</h6>
<p>Paragraph - for any generic text (non-heading text)</p>that 
-> Miscellaneous Tags concern themselves with the workings of all other HTML tag functionalities. There's loads of them but only 20% of them do 80% of the work. You can read more about them here but the main ones are as follows:

<input/>
for user inputs such as text, dates, files and so on (self-closing)
<textarea>default text...</textarea>
for larger text inputs
<img/>
for img displays
<mark>highlighted text</mark>
for text highlights/emphasis
<details></details>
for text open/close models
<button>Click me</button>
for button text display
<a>link text</a>
anchor tags are for links to internal or external web pages

1.5 Code Commenting in HTML
We can create invisible notes in our HTML code that only developers in the code base can see. These will not appear on the web page. This can be used in cases such as organizing and labeling sections in code, describing what the code is supposed to be working on and targeting.

Code comments cannot be nested (one contained within another).

To create a code comment, simply wrap your desired note or comment within the following syntax:

<!-- COMMENT GOES IN HERE & YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE! EVEN ADD EMOJIS 🔥 -->

Others also use this pair /*  */

For example:
/* COMMENT GOES IN HERE & YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE! EVEN ADD EMOJIS 🔥 */
