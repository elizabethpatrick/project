Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it's technically not a programming language, but instead, a markup language. For now, we'll think of it as a glorified word document. In a word document, you can create text headers, add links, display images and well, HTML isn't that different.

1.1 Creating an HTML Document
To get started coding in HTML, we first need to create an HTML document. We can do that by initializing a new file, just as if we we're create a standard word document, giving it any name followed by the .html suffix. For example ->

index.html

This file should be located within a folder that is known as your project directory. We can have multiple HTML files within the project directory, where each file can be used as a subroute for our HTML webpage.

The default HTML page will always be the one named index.html. An example project directory is as follows:

project_directory
|- index.html
|- about.html
|- contact.html

1.2 Initializing an HTML Document
Now that we have our project created our document, we can go ahead and open it up. HTML documents always start off with a little bit of boilerplate code that looks as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        visible content goes here . . .
    </body>
</html>
If you're using VSCode as your editor, we can quickly generate this boilerplate code using the intellisense. If you type the ! key, it will prompt you to create the code.

1.2.1 Local Development
You could right click on index.html and then click open with live server to see how it would look as you code.
To get your code live in a local development environment & to see how it looks, simply drag and drop any html file (typically the index.html) onto your browser. Page refresh after saving changes to your HTML document to see the updated changes.

1.3 HTML Tags
If we take a look at the code displayed above, there's a few key observations worth taking note of.

HTML is created using tags. Tags (sometimes referred to as elements) are the keywords surrounded by the greater-than and lesser-than brackets, or the < & > keys.
Most tags have an opening and paired closing tag. Any contents contained within the associated opening and closing tags is known as the children contents. The opening tag always appears first, and the closing tag can be discerned from the opening tag via the use of the forwards slash /.
For example -> <div> child contents </div>
The left hand tag is the opening tag, and the right most tag is the closing tag as we see it has the forwards slash.
Some tags are self closing. This means that the opening tag has a forwards slash at the end of the tag as opposed to at the start of the closing tag.
<input />
HTML tags are either semantic or non-semantic. Semantic tags imply more meaning about the subcontents that non-semantic tags. Some examples of semantic tags are as follows:
Single use <head> · <body> · <header> · <nav> · <footer> · <main>
Multi use <section> · <details> · <summary> · <aside> · <time>
Tag pairs contained within other tag pairs are known as Nested tags.
