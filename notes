Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it's technically not a programming language, but instead, a markup language. For now, we'll think of it as a glorified word document. In a word document, you can create text headers, add links, display images and well, HTML isn't that different.

1.1 Creating an HTML Document
To get started coding in HTML, we first need to create an HTML document. We can do that by initializing a new file, just as if we we're create a standard word document, giving it any name followed by the .html suffix. For example ->

index.html

This file should be located within a folder that is known as your project directory. We can have multiple HTML files within the project directory, where each file can be used as a subroute for our HTML webpage.

The default HTML page will always be the one named index.html. An example project directory is as follows:

project_directory
|- index.html
|- about.html
|- contact.html
